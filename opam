synopsis: "Bindings to the ClanLib library"

description: """
OCaml bindings to the ClanLib library.

ClanLib is a game SDK providing interfaces for 2D graphics, input, sound,
resources, networking, GUI, OpenGL, and more. The goal is to provide a game
SDK that does all the dirty work that all modern games need to implement
anyway, thus making the game developer concentrate on the gameplay instead
of reinventing the wheel over and over again.

This version of the bindings is known to work with ClanLib versions
2.1.2 or 2.3.7
